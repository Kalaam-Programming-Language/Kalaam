          Kalaam is the programming language in Hindi and has all the basic functionalities of a modern programming
          language. From for loops to while loops and from functions to conditional statements.

          Programming needs to reach every part of India if we have to produce more number of quality startups and
          technically sound ecosystem. Language and unfamiliarity should not become barriers to these students to learn
          to code. Familiarity can make anything more connected, and learning does not seem shallow. What could be more
          familiar than the language we used for communication. The language between friends and families is now a
          language between human and computer .

        <p>
          Anyone with a smartphone or a computer can start coding in Kalaam. <br />

              Technology is the next big thing for the growth of India, and programming is how we can make it happen.
              India has massive untapped talent in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Most of the students and parents are aware
              of how technology is going to shape lives in the future, but they are not even aware of this concept
              called computer programming.

              <br />
              <br />

              I have talked to directors of numerous coaching classes in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. All shared a similar
              concern over programming penetration in such parts of India. We are missing out on the talented ecosystem
              of these students just because they believe programming is an out of bound thing for them. Even if they
              know about it, it sounds alien to them because of syntax, courses, and unfamiliarity with the learning
              process. Since it's completely new territory for them, they either get confused and lose interest or
              postpone learning it.

              Kalam, a programming language in Hindi, dedicated to Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, will solve this problem of
              improving coding literacy in remote parts of India. Kalaam is the first-ever online programming language
              in Hindi and has all the basic functionalities of a modern programming language. Anyone with a smartphone
              or a computer can start coding in Kalaam. The syntax and grammar of Kalaam are developed in such a way
              that students will find flexibility in adopting other languages too.

              <br />
              <br />
              Kalaam coding environment can also be made offline and installable on the user device. Students can code
              for a lifetime on Kalaam without a need for the internet in the next version.

              Before going open source, I need to make sure that the code is friendly to read and understand. Most of
              this work will include detailed comments for almost every line of code. You can stay updated with the

              Comments is an experimental feature for now and might introduce some issues. You can still go on and use
              <b> <i>"#This is a comment"</i></b> like format with mandatory '#' at the beginning of every comment.

              I will be sharing my journey on my Youtube and if you want to get more access to underlying logic, you can
              do that when language will be made opens source. Alternatively, you can also join Kalaam discord server

              Kalaam is still in it's first stage and have been tested by handful of people. The issue that you might
              face will be very minor and can be fixed in a day or two. Please make sure to share your feedback and
              faced issues on Kalaam discord server or my instagram handle so that Kalaam community can keep on
              improving the language.
