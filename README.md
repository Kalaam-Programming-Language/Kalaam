<h2 align="center">Supporting Kalaam</h2>

## Introduction

Kalaam is the programming language in Hindi and has all the basic functionalities of a modern programming language. From for loops to while loops and from functions to conditional statements.

Kalaam has it's own parser, interpreter, Virtual memory stack and executes source code from parse tree generated by the parser.

Thank you to all the amazing developers who showed interest in contributing to the development of Kalaam.

## Branch Guide

## Compiler

- All the compiler related work is done here. No frontend pull requests here, this space belongs to backend people.

## Frontend-UI

- All the compiler, UI work is done here. No Compiler/Backend pull requests here, this space belongs to frontend people.

## dev-Kalaam-nextVersion

- As the name suggests, this will contain the latest and stable Kalaam code. If everything performs as expected, this will be merged with the master.
- Test, Test, Test!

## Contributions

- You can work on either Frontend, Backend or Documentation, whatever you think you can be best at with your current level of experience.
- This is a complete Kalaam.io application. The compiler is available as a standalone npm package called Kalaam-core.
- Fork the repo by selecting the branch you want to work on.
- Feel free to play with frontend or backend. Creative ideas are most welcome.
- Use Kalaam Discord sever to connect with fellow contributors.

#` NOTE: MAKE SURE TO CREATE A PULL REQUEST ON 'dev-Kalaam-nextVersion' and NOT DIRECTLY ON THE MASTER BRANCH.`#


## Future plans

- Right now, Kalaam is in it's early stage. Many programming languages took decades of team work to reach their God level. We go step by step.
- Kalaam needs to have a usecase so that people can start building stuff with it like apps, websites, extensions, plugins. The use-case can be unique that suits well to the Indian ecosystem. This will help us to move in a straight direction.
- Consider Kalaam as your project, explore it and feel free to try out new ideas.

## Documentation

To check out documentation visit [Documentation](https://www.kalaam.io/documentation).

- Documentation needs a lot of work. I think short video tuts will really help instead of just the overload of texts.

## Examples

To check out examples visit [live examples](https://www.kalaam.io/examples).

Feel free to add more examples. We have three categories for examples. Basic, Intermediate, and advanced. Add according to context.

## Questions

For questions and support please use [the discord server](https://discord.com/invite/EMyA8TA).

## NPM

- Kalaam compiler package is available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/kalaam-core as "Kalaam-core".

P.S- The package is not setup for named exports yet like import 'Compile' from 'Kalaam-core'.
Instead, use the node_modules path like import 'Compile' from '../node_modules/src/lib/Compiler/main.js'

## Where is the compiler code?:

Visit 'src/lib/Compiler/main.js' in repo structure to access Kalaam compile engine and learn about how Kalaam works.

## To test kalaam.io locally

The setups for recreating the project have been given in the [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) file.
